##Calc

You put $10,000 into a bank account that earns 5% interest per year.
How many years does it take for the account to be double the original balance?

Year 0 = 10,000

Year 1 = 10,000 x 1.05 = 10,500

Year 2 = 10,500 x 1.05 = 11,025

Year 3 = 11,025 x 1.05 = 11,576.25

##Cell

Suppose your cell phone carrier charges you $29.95 for up to 300 minutes of calls,
and $0.45 for each additional minute, plus 12.5% taxes and fees. Give an algorithm
to compute the monthly charge from a given number of minutes.
