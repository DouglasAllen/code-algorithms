##Calc

You put $10,000 into a bank account that earns 5% interest per year.
How many years does it take for the account to be double the original balance?

Year 0 = 10,000

Year 1 = 10,000 x 1.05 = 10,500

Year 2 = 10,500 x 1.05 = 11,025

Year 3 = 11,025 x 1.05 = 11,576.25

##College

A bank account starts with $10,000. Interest is compounded at 6% per year or
0.5% monthly. Every month, $500 is withdrawn for college expenses. After how many years is the account
depleted?

##Balance

Write a program that prints the balance of an account after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd year.
The account has an initial balance of $1000 and earns a percent interest of 5% yearly.

##Cell

Suppose your cell phone carrier charges you $29.95 for up to 300 minutes of calls,
and $0.45 for each additional minute, plus 12.5% taxes and fees. Give an algorithm
to compute the monthly charge from a given number of minutes.
